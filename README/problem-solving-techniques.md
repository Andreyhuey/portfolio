# Problem-Solving Techniques

## Backtracking

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used to explore all possible solutions to a problem by building a solution incrementally. If a partial solution is invalid or doesn't lead to a valid solution, it "backs up" and tries a different path.

Problems involving combinations, permutations, or paths, where constraints must be satisfied.

- Broader Applications of Backtracking
  Backtracking is a versatile technique used for solving many problems, such as:

Combinatorics: Generating permutations, combinations, or subsets.
Sudoku Solvers: Trying all possible placements until the puzzle is solved.
Maze Solvers: Exploring paths in a grid until you reach the destination.
N-Queens Problem: Placing queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
String Problems: Like this oneâ€”generating valid parentheses!

## Divide and conquer

Divide and conquer is a general algorithm design paradigm where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is solved independently, and their solutions are combined to solve the original problem.

Examples: Merge sort : complexity of (O (n log n)), quicksort, binary search.
